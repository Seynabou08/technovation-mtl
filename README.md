# Code with me: Image Segmentation


## The data

Imat dataset In this dataset, you are provided a large number of images and corresponding fashion/apparel segmentations. Images are named with a unique ImageId. You must segment and classify the images in the test set. The 2020 version of this dataset uses the same images as the 2019 version, however, the attributes have been relabeled and expanded.
